# realization-of-SON-Algorithm-using-the-Spark-Framework
SON algorithm is an algorithm that can be help finding similar item.   
It is wildly used by famous companies such as Amazon, Google, Meta for content recommendation.  

  
For example, when you see an **Ads that is advertising something related to your personal interests**,  
or, for example, **Amazon's "similar product based on your purchase" **   
it all thanks to the **SON-like Algorithms** behind the scenes.   

 
In this project, I will implement the SON Algorithm using the Spark Framework. I will develop a program to find frequent itemsets in two datasets, one simulated dataset and one real-world generated dataset. The goal of this assignment is to apply the algorithms I have learned in class on large datasets more efficiently in a distributed environment.  

Here is the Link that explains SON algorithm: http://www.sfu.ca/~cjbrown/pdfs/cmpt741_proj_hadoop.pdf
